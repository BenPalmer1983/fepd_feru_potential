     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     one sub-group per band group will be used
     ELPA distributed-memory algorithm (size of sub-group:  8*  8 procs)

     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead
