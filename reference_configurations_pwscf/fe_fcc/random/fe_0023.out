     hartree contribution      =    1999.26664237 Ry
     xc contribution           =    -886.97571020 Ry
     ewald contribution        =   -5701.06594497 Ry
     one-center paw contrib.   =   -2649.55807594 Ry

     total magnetization       =     0.02 Bohr mag/cell
     absolute magnetization    =    49.22 Bohr mag/cell

     convergence has been achieved in  36 iterations
